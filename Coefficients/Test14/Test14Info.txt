Test 14
in this test the wave parameters were 
 int res = 161;
        double c0 = 2.998e8;
        double lambda = 800.0e-9;
        double omega = 2*M_PI*c0/lambda;
        double dx = lambda/res;
        double dt = dx/(sqrt(2.0)*c0);
        double Tau = 2*res*dt;
        double tdelay = 5*Tau;

the grid was:

for (mm = 200; mm < 1390; mm++) {
                for (nn = 0; nn < SizeY; nn++) {
                        Ceze(mm, nn) = 1.0; 
                        Cezh(mm, nn) = (Cdtds*imp0)/4.0;
                }
   }
  for (mm = 1390; mm < 1418; mm++) {
                for (nn = 0; nn < SizeY; nn++) {
                        Ceze(mm, nn) = 1.0;  
                        Cezh(mm, nn) = (Cdtds*imp0)/2.0;
                }
   } 

I achieved the curve by finding the wavelength that was actually being "anti-reflected" and using that to figure out the grid size of my simulation.
